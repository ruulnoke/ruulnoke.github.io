These are views from the sauna timer in my imaginary home application management app. You can try the Finnish prototype in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/L5OzfxoXWIgNtj1Wkm9obL/WEB-UI-2---lopputehtava?node-id=307-658&t=7A9CcyyfCQgZUO7z-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=307%3A376&starting-point-node-id=307%3A658&).

I created these pages with Figma for an imaginary mobile software project we worked on as a team on a course about software engineering process in 2022. The icons (apart from the filter icon which I created myself) are from Mobile Wireframe UI Kit library offered by Figmaâ€™s community. The images are from Pexels.com.

These pages are from my first mock-up ever, autumn 2020. These are for my imaginary mobile app for buying Christmas wrecking services. I created the views with Adobe Photoshop and drew the gingerbread icon with Adobe Illustrator. The smartphone frame is by Zlatko Plamenov from Freepik.com. The images are from Pexels.com.
