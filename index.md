<style>
.container {
  display:flex;
  flex-flow: row wrap;
  justify-content: space-around;
}

I created these mockup pages with Figma for a faux mobile software project in 2022, on a course about software engineering process. The icons (apart from the filter icon which I created myself) are from Mobile Wireframe UI Kit library offered by Figma’s community. The images are from Pexels.com.

These pages are from my first mock-up ever, autumn 2020. I created them for my own imaginary Mobile app. The smartphone mockup frame is by Zlatko Plamenov from Freepik.com. The images are from Pexels.com.
