I created these mock-up pages for a faux mobile software project in 2022, on a course about software engineering process. A half of our team worked with Figma. The icons (apart from the filter icon which I created myself) are from Mobile Wireframe UI Kit library offered by Figma’s community. The images are from Pexels.com.

These pages are from my first mock-up ever, autumn 2020. I created them for my own imaginary Mobile app. The smartphone mock-up frame is by Zlatko Plamenov from Freepik.com. The images are from Pexels.com.
